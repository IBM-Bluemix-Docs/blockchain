**Support for external CA**

When you add a peer or orderer node, you have the option to use certificates from an external CA, one that is not hosted by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. See this topic on [Using certificates from an external CA with your peer or orderer](/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network-third-party-ca) for more information.

**Tuning orderer performance**

New orderer tuning parameters are available in the console to give you more control over your orderer throughput and performance. See this topic on [Tuning your orderer](/docs/services/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-govern#ibp-console-govern-orderer-tuning) for instructions on how to configure the parameters.
