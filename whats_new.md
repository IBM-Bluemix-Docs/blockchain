{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform releases {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for AWS enables you to run peers in the AWS Cloud and connect the peers to existing blockchain networks in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You peers in AWS can leverage the connection profile and other blockchain components in the existing networks, while giving you more flexibility to colocate your peers with other applications outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform for Amazon Web Services](howto/remote_peer.html).

## October 4, 2018

{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform upgrades Starter Plan from Hyperledger Fabric v1.1.0 to v1.2.1. For more information, see [About Starter Plan](starter_plan.html).

**Important:** Fabric v1.2.1 is currently not compatible with the Remote Peer beta, which uses a v1.1.0 peer. Starter Plan networks, which are created before October 4, 2018 and are based on Fabric v1.1.0, are not impacted and can still be used with the Remote Peer beta. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform will update the Remote Peer beta to use the v1.2.1 peer, which will be compatible with new Starter networks, which are at Fabric v1.2.1 level, and Enterprise networks, which are at Fabric v1.1.0 level. Until the Remote Peer beta is updated to Fabric v1.2.1, do not attempt to deploy a v1.1.0 remote peer with a new v1.2.1 Starter network.
