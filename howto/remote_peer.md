# About remote peers
{: #remote-peer-overview}


***[Is this page helpful? Tell us.](https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4501493/IBM-Blockchain-Documentation)***


**Important:**
Starting from October 04, 2018, all new {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Starter networks will be provisioned by using Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.1 Fabric v1.2.1 is currently not compatible with the Remote Peer offering, which uses a v1.1.0 peer. Existing Starter Plan networks, which are based on Fabric v1.1.0, are not impacted and can still be used with the Remote Peer offering. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} Platform will update the Remote Peer offering to use the v1.2.1 peer, which will be compatible with new Starter networks, which uses Fabric v1.2.1, and Enterprise networks, which still use Fabric v1.1.0. Until the Remote Peer offering is updated to Fabric v1.2.1, **do not** attempt to deploy a v1.1.0 remote peer with a new v1.2.1 Starter network.

You can run {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform remote peers on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private (ICP) <!--[AWS]or on AWS Cloud --> after you connect them to an existing blockchain network. Running peers outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides more flexibility to grow or join a blockchain network while taking advantage of an existing network inside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Remote peers leverage the Certificate Authorities (CAs) and Ordering Service on the platform, but allow you to colocate your peer with other applications outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

<!--[AWS]Move ICP description here.-->{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private (ICP) is a Kubernetes-based platform for building a private cloud in an on-premises environment. You can use ICP to run a remote peer and connect the remote peer to a blockchain network on {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Remote Peer for ICP leverages the storage, security, logging, and support services of ICP so that you can manage your remote peers in your on-premises environment. For more information about ICP, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private documentation ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0.3/kc_welcome_containers.html "{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private documentation").  

**Note:** {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Remote Peer is currently a Beta offering that is suitable for evaluation and experimentation. **This Beta edition is not intended for production usage.** For access and more information, see [license and pricing](#remote-peer-license-pricing).


<!--[AWS]The following cloud platforms are supported:-->
<!--[AWS]
|  Cloud Platform | Supported Versions |
| ----------------|--------------------|
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private (ICP) | 2.1.0.3 |
-->
<!--[AWS]
|  Cloud Platform | Instance types |
| ----------------|--------------------|
| Amazon Web Services (AWS) | Choose from the list of available types. The minimum size is `t2.medium`, the default is `m4.xlarge`|
-->

<!--[AWS]In all cases, the network on {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform and the remote peer nodes must be running at the same **Fabric version 1.1**.
-->

The Beta edition supports the cloud platform of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private (ICP), v2.1.0.3. Note that the network on {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform and the remote peer nodes in ICP must run at the same **Fabric version 1.1**.

## Considerations
{: #remote-peer-limitations}

A remote peer does not have access to the full functionality or support of peers that are hosted on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. Before you run remote peers, ensure that you understand the following restrictions and limitations:
- Remote peers that run in other cloud environments are not visible in the Network Monitor of the blockchain network on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- Remote peers cannot be addressed by using the Swagger UI in the Network Monitor UI.
- You are responsible for the management of health monitoring, security, logging, and resource usage of your remote peers.
- You can connect your remote peers only to blockchain networks that are at Hyperledger Fabric v1.1 level.
- The database type of the remote peer must match the database type of your blockchain network, either LevelDB or CouchDB.
- The CouchDB Fauxton interface is not available on the remote peer.
- [Gossip](../glossary.html#gossip) for remote peers is not currently supported.


## Prerequisites
{: #remote-peer-prereq}

To use a remote peer, you must have an organization that is a member of a Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan network on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. The remote peer leverages the API endpoints, Hyperledger Fabric CAs, and Ordering Service of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Plan network to operate. If you are not a member of any blockchain network, you need to create or join a network. For more information, see [Creating a network](../get_start.html#creating-a-network) or [Joining a network](../get_start.html#joining-a-network).


## License and pricing
{: #remote-peer-license-pricing}

<!--[AWS]To access remote peers on AWS Cloud, see [License and pricing in AWS](remote_peer_aws.html#license-pricing-icp "License and pricing in AWS"). -->To access remote peers to run on ICP, see [License and pricing for remote peers on ICP](remote_peer_icp.html#license-pricing-icp "License and pricing for remote peers on ICP"). The licenses for the Beta edition of remote peers are free.<!--[AWS] for both platforms.--> Afterward, a generally available (GA) offering will replace the beta edition.

Migration from Beta to GA is not supported. You need to download and install new remote peers to use the GA offering, when it is released. You can then join new remotes peers to the same channels of the same network as your Beta remote peers.

**Note:** To operate a remote peer, you must have an organization that belongs to a Starter Plan or Enterprise Plan network on {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. This implies that you or another member in the network must pay the IBM Blockchain [membership fee](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/pricing.html#key-elements-of-pricing) for your organization. For more information about paying fees, see [Paying mode](paying_mode.html).

## Operating a remote peer
{: #operate-remote-peer}

After you deploy the remote peer, you need to complete several operational steps before your peer can submit transactions to the network. The operational steps include adding your organization to a channel, joining your remote peer to the channel, installing chaincode on your remote peer, instantiating chaincode on the channel, and connecting applications to your remote peer. For more information, see <!--[AWS][Operating remote peers in Amazon Web Service](remote_peer_operate_aws.html#remote-peer-operate-aws) or -->[Operating remote peers in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](remote_peer_operate_icp.html#remote-peer-operate).

## Data residency
{: #data-residency}

Data residency requirements are restrictions that govern where data might reside. The most common requirement on data residency is associated with laws within certain countries, which mandate all customer data that is processed and stored in an IT system must remain within a specific country’s borders. Similarly, some companies in highly regulated industries, such as government, healthcare, and financial services, require that all their data must be stored entirely behind their firewall. Additionally, some companies have a corporate policy where certain types of data, Personally Identifiable Information typically, must remain private and be entirely behind their corporate firewall. Therefore, to achieve data residency, all components of the blockchain network must be part of the same [channel](../glossary.html#channel) and reside within the border of a single country.

To address data residency requirements, it is important to understand the Hyperledger Fabric architecture that underlies {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. The architecture is centered around three key components: Ordering Service, Certificate Authority (CA), and Peer. A peer receives ordered state updates in the form of blocks from the ordering service and maintains the state and the ledger. Therefore, a peer and an ordering service have a direct relationship. The ledger contains the latest values for all keys and the data that the transaction logs include.

Additionally, client applications use the [Fabric SDKs](../v10_application.html#using-the-fabric-sdks) to send transactions to the peers and ordering service. These transactions include [read-write set ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/readwrite.html "Read-Write set semantics") data, which contains the key-value pairs on the ledger.

If in-country data residency is a requirement for your business, the ordering service, peer nodes, and client application should reside in the same country. When an {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network is created in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you have the choice of selecting a location for the network. <!--For a Starter Plan network, you can select from US South, United Kingdom, and Sydney. For an Enterprise Plan network, you can select from currently available locations, which include Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Toronto. -->For more information about regions and locations, see [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform regions and locations](../reference/ibp_regions.html). To achieve data residency in one of these countries, your remote peer should reside in the same country as the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network location.

If the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network contains remote peer and ordering service nodes across country borders, you can use channels to segregate data to a subset of peers on the network. Ordering nodes are always located in the data center that you selected to host the network. It is not possible to have orderers across country borders. But peers can be located either in the data center or at a remote location outside {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Therefore, to achieve data residency, a channel can be created in which the orderer and all peers, either peers that is local to the data center or remote peers, reside in the same country. In this way, all data that the orderer and peers share stays within the borders of a single country. Other channels can still exist if needed, where the orderer and remote peers are located across country borders and data residency is not required.

In the future, new technology in Hyperledger Fabric will improve the ability to achieve further data residency by using [Private data collections ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/private-data/private-data.html "Private data collections") and Zero Knowledge Proof.

- A Private data collection ensures that the private data is shared peer-to-peer (via the gossip protocol) to only authorized peers to see it, for example, peers that are within the country borders. The data is stored in a private database on the peer.  The ordering service is not involved here and does not see the private data. A hash of that data is written to the ledgers of every peer on the channel. The hash that is used for state validation serves as evidence of the transaction, and can be used for audit purposes.

- A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) allows a “prover” to assure a “verifier” that they have knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself. It's a way to show that you know something that satisfies a statement without showing what you know.

For more information about these technologies, see the white paper about [Private and confidential transactions with Hyperledger Fabric ![External link icon](../images/external_link.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-private-confidential-transactions-hyperledger-fabric-zero-knowledge-proof/index.html "Private and confidential transactions with Hyperledger Fabric").
